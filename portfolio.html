			<p style="max-width: 500px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">Another small map I made, this time for April Fools 2022. Inspired by the unreleased game Desert Bus (unless you count the remakes), this map takes you on a journey for 8 real hours.<br>
			Despite the lacking gameplay, the visuals are still somewhat decent for such a small map.</p>

			<p style="max-width: 500px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">An entry and the 1st place winner of the Mapeadores Prey Inauguration Contest.
			This was the first map I actually fully delved into making look aesthetically pleasing. A big portion of the initial development was spent on the visuals of this map. I wanted to "wow" the judges and playtesters with the distinct visual style of the map. And that seemed to land it 1st place.<br>
			Gameplay was also a big factor, trying to account for the various classes and gameplay differences from regular Zombie Mod. A lot was learned during the making of this map, in terms of both detailing and gameplay perspectives.</p>

			<p style="max-width: 500px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">This was an extremely small map I made, trying to fit the final map file in under 1mb. The final size was 860kb, with still semi-decent gameplay. It was made for a mini Halloween mapping event in 2021, so the theme is this decrepid looping hallway.<br>
			Where the size is small, and the gameplay could be improved, it is still a good map for lower player-counts or some quick fun.</p>

			<p style="max-width: 500px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">Solgryn was my attempt at a "big map", visuals are not the best but it makes up for it in the gameplay. Entered to the 2020 Zombie Escape Mapping Contest, I did not take home any prize money.<br>
			Although I did not place within the top 5 winners, I learned a vast amount about Source Engine mapping, in terms of gameplay and other areas. I strived to be too much like existing maps with Solgryn, and didn't really offer my own unique ideas.</p>

			<p style="max-width: 500px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">My first map I publically released. LOLXD is a map I'm genuinely proud of, despite it's age and my lack of knowledge when making it.<br>
			It has a unique visual style and it's gameplay is well suited for a variety of players, offering some unique takes and a "self-aware" mindset within the map.</p>

			<h1>Collaborations</h2>

			<p style="max-width: 500px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">I made a few areas for MAPEADORES MUSEUM, as did many other mappers. A total of 16 mappers helped to create this map, each one making a self-contained map within 2048^3 units.<br>
			I made 3 areas, SSS-lite (a mini version of a previous popular map), DYSTOPIA (a downtown cyberpunk-ish area) and the GOLEVATOR (an elevator powered by player-chat spam).</p>

			<p style="max-width: 500px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">My first map collaboration. 5 mappers made their own unique minigame that would be randomly selected to be played, followed by a "finale" after completion of all 5 minigames.<br>
			I created a simple minigame where players would spread out and find objects to destroy, while avoiding enemies, hence the name "Weeaboo Anihilation". Also helped with making a few useable items and some other miscellaneous things.</p>
